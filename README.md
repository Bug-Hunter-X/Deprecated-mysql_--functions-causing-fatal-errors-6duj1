This repository contains a simple PHP script that demonstrates the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions, along with a corrected version using the `mysqli_*` extension.  The original script will throw a fatal error in PHP 7 and later, while the corrected script provides a modern, secure alternative.  The `mysql_*` functions are outdated and pose security risks.  Always use `mysqli_*` or PDO for database interactions.
